# Stamurai

An android app which allows you to set a rating range and then also submit ratings in those range.
The submitted ratings appear in the history section of the app.

# Technologies used

The app is written in Kotlin, and I have also used SQLite to maintain the history section of the app.

On opening the app, the user would be presented with a screen with options to set the rating range

<img src="./app/Images/image3.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
<img src="./app/Images/image4.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

Once valid range is set, the user may submit ratings.
<img src="./app/Images/image1.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

The previous ratings are then made visible in the history fragment.
<img src="./app/Images/image2.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
